/**
 * @class StopWatch
 * @brief This class measures the CPU time used between two moments
 *
 * It uses the ctime library to call time(), which is measuring the
 * CPU time used by the process so far. It works nicely as long as the
 * counter does not flip over (which should happen every 72 minutes at
 * most in a 32 bit CPU) The stop watch is started by the constructyor
 * (and by restart()) and it gives the elapsed CPU time in seconds
 * when asked
