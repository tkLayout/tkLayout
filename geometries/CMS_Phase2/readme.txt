OT_Tilted_363_200_Pixel_4021.cfg     OT Version 3.6.3 !! Work in progress !!
                                     This is just an intermediary version towards an optimized TBPS. Main optimization point
                                     should be the reduction of TBPS planks δ and Δ, by 5 mm and 1 mm respectively
                                     Position of first ring (by changing zOverlap) was moved in such a way to keep the distance between the centre of the last flat module and the centre of the first
                                     tilted module (in z)

                                     Radii and zOverlap of first rings were then changed so as to obtain zError_outer ~50mm, ~70mm, ~70mm for layers 1, 2, 3 at the transition

OT_Tilted_364_200_Pixel_4021.cfg     OT Version 3.6.4 !! Work in progress !!
                                     Starting the same process as for 3.6.3, with updated δ
                                     Layer 1: δ = 3.9mm
                                     Layer 2, 3: δ = 3.4mm
                                     Since the first tilted ring -> last flat ring had a Δz = 43.58 mm and was already considered to be "close"
                                     and the δ reduction caused this number to further shrink (down to 43.33) , we adjusted zOverlap (16.0 → 15.5)
                                     to push back Δz to 43.62 (basically the same as 3.6.3). Layer 2 and 3 are not expected to be troublesome with a
                                     Δz(last flat → first tilted) = 47.1 and 46.8 respectively).
                                     Overall the change 3.6.3 → 3.6.4 had a positive effect on the coverage of tracks from the origin, with
                                     zErrorOuter = { 51.8, 76.0, 78.8 }: a slight reduction for layer 1 and an increase for layers 2 and 3

                                             6 2S rings in TEDD1&2
                                           overlap mainly through bigDelta (and 2S)
                                           phioverlap = -2

OT603_200_IT4025.cfg                      like 602, but overlap mainly through PS modules

OT611_200_IT4025.cfg                      TDR geometry

OT611_200_IT4125.cfg		     	Like TDR geometry, but with 50x50 pixels instead of 25x100

OT711_200_IT4025.cfg                      Like 6.1.1 TDR geometry but with paired-up layers:
                                             Z coordinates in TEDD: 1356.8 1440 1854.67 1937.67 2567 2650
                                             while keeping the radial positions as in 6.1.1
                                          TB2D radii taken from 4.6.3
                                          TBPS configuration as in 6.1.1, but reducing L2 radius to have 1 cm clearance (incl. hybrid) to L1


                                          
OT612_200_IT4025.cfg	Like 6.1.1 but with slightly larger PS modules

OT613_200_IT4025.cfg	Like 6.1.2 but fixing bigDelta according to Nick 2017-03-27
                         Zd=29.7mm or bigDelta=14.85
                         New geometry 6.1.3 with slight adjustment in TEDD1 and TEDD2: bigDeelta moved from 14.15mm to 14.85mm
                         this would cause a movement of 1.243mm and 1.351mm in innermost rings of TEDD1 and TEDD2 respectively
                         and add 4 modules in one ring of TEDD2.
                        Any ring movement was instead *avoided* by constraining the ring radii to those of 6.1.2, so that the geometry in the
                        xy plane is exactly the same
