OT_Tilted_363_200_Pixel_4021.cfg     OT Version 3.6.3 !! Work in progress !!
                                     This is just an intermediary version towards an optimized TBPS. Main optimization point
                                     should be the reduction of TBPS planks δ and Δ, by 5 mm and 1 mm respectively
                                     Position of first ring (by changing zOverlap) was moved in such a way to keep the distance between the centre of the last flat module and the centre of the first
                                     tilted module (in z)

                                     Radii and zOverlap of first rings were then changed so as to obtain zError_outer ~50mm, ~70mm, ~70mm for layers 1, 2, 3 at the transition

OT_Tilted_364_200_Pixel_4021.cfg     OT Version 3.6.4 !! Work in progress !!
                                     Starting the same process as for 3.6.3, with updated δ
                                     Layer 1: δ = 3.9mm
                                     Layer 2, 3: δ = 3.4mm
                                     Since the first tilted ring -> last flat ring had a Δz = 43.58 mm and was already considered to be "close"
                                     and the δ reduction caused this number to further shrink (down to 43.33) , we adjusted zOverlap (16.0 → 15.5)
                                     to push back Δz to 43.62 (basically the same as 3.6.3). Layer 2 and 3 are not expected to be troublesome with a
                                     Δz(last flat → first tilted) = 47.1 and 46.8 respectively).
                                     Overall the change 3.6.3 → 3.6.4 had a positive effect on the coverage of tracks from the origin, with
                                     zErrorOuter = { 51.8, 76.0, 78.8 }: a slight reduction for layer 1 and an increase for layers 2 and 3

OT711_200_IT4025.cfg                      Like 6.1.1 TDR geometry but with paired-up layers:
                                             Z coordinates in TEDD: 1356.8 1440 1854.67 1937.67 2567 2650
                                             while keeping the radial positions as in 6.1.1
                                          TB2D radii taken from 4.6.3
                                          TBPS configuration as in 6.1.1, but reducing L2 radius to have 1 cm clearance (incl. hybrid) to L1


                                          
OT612_200_IT4025.cfg	Like 6.1.1 but with slightly larger PS modules


======================   TDR LAYOUT   ====================

OT613_200_IT4025.cfg	   Like 6.1.2 but fixing bigDelta according to Nick 2017-03-27
                         Zd=29.7mm or bigDelta=14.85
                         New geometry 6.1.3 with slight adjustment in TEDD1 and TEDD2: bigDelta moved from 14.15mm to 14.85mm
                         this would cause a movement of 1.243mm and 1.351mm in innermost rings of TEDD1 and TEDD2 respectively
                         and add 4 modules in one ring of TEDD2.
                        Any ring movement was instead *avoided* by constraining the ring radii to those of 6.1.2, so that the geometry in the
                        xy plane is exactly the same

                                     Based from Inner Tracker version 6.1.3.
                                     Zebra layout: Alternation of layers with 25x100 and 50x50 pixel aspect ratios.
                                     Layouts fully with 25x100 or 50x50 were studied, but not one that would include a mix of the 2!

                                     Same as IT 6.1.5., but with 50x50 everywhere (instead of 25x100).

                                     Based from Inner Tracker version 6.1.5.
                                     Reduced holes in TBPX L1 and L2: 1.3 mm -> 0.6 mm, to account for future 3D sensors spacing.

                                     Based from Inner Tracker version 6.9.9.
                                     Same geometry + materials, but 3D sensor type in TBPX L1 + TBPX L2 + TFPX R1 (+ slightly different inactive Si).

OT800_IT701.cfg                      OT Version 8.0.0
                                     Based from Inner Tracker version 7.0.0.
                                     TFPX: Change of ring paradigm: modules of the same ring are now on 2 different dees, instead of being on both sides of the same dee.
                                     This model is already used in TEPX. 
                                     This makes the dee model mecanically feasible (cut at X~0), and better equilibrates services distribution among disks.
