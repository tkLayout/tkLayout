# Getting the code

   git clone https://github.com/tkLayout/tkLayout.git
   cd tkLayout

# Before the compilation/run

You need a working version of root active (root and root-config should be in your path) and a few
libraries are required:
  * boost_filesystem
  * boost_regex
  * the root library set

If you are on lxplus you just have to run a bash shell and then

     source setup_slc6.sh


# Compilation

Compilation using make:

    make

This will build the needed programs and put them in the ./bin directory.

Compilation using cmake (NEW):

    mkdir build     (all object files, help files, libs, ... will be kept here)
    cd build
    cmake ..        (generate makefile)
    make install    (or write make all + make install)
    make doc        (generate Doxygen-based documentation in doc directory)

    make uninstall  (if cleaning needed)
    rm *            (clean all content in build directory & restart if needed)

This will build the needed programs, copy the executables into tkLayout/bin directory and create symlink in ${HOME}/bin directory.


# Install
  If the make command runs properly you can install the program with the script

     make install

## First-time install
If this is the first time that you install tkLayout, a few questions will be asked and a configuration
fle will be created in $HOME/.tkgeometry:

1. You will need to provide the destination directory for the www output of the program (proabably
  something like /afs/cern.ch/user/y/yourname/www/layouts) this directory needs to be writable by you
  and readable by the web server.
     The style files will be copied during the installation to that directory (for example
  /afs/cern.ch/user/y/yourname/www/layouts/style ). If the style files get changed during the development
  a new ./install.sh will be needed to get this propagated to the output.
     Alternatively, you can choose to make a symbolic link between the source directory style directory and
  the layout directory. This avoids the need of repeating the ./install.sh at every update of the style files
  but in order to do this the source directory should also be within the reach of the web server.

# Update
To get the latest development version (usually UNSTABLE) you simply type

    git fetch
    git chechout master
    make
    make install
